# Bilbasen Fiat Panda Finder - Development Log

## Project Overview
This conversation documents the development of a comprehensive Python project that scrapes Bilbasen.dk for Fiat Panda listings, scores them based on multiple criteria, and serves a dark-themed web dashboard.

## Initial Requirements
Based on the prompt from `claude_code_bilbasen_prompt.md`, the project requirements include:

1. **Web Scraping**: Scrape https://www.bilbasen.dk/ for "Fiat Panda" listings
2. **Scoring System**: Score listings on price, year, condition, kilometers (0-100 scale)
3. **Web Dashboard**: Dark, slick browser dashboard with:
   - Top 10 deals
   - Score distribution chart
   - Filters for price, year, km
4. **Testing & CI**: Thorough tests and CI pipeline
5. **GitHub Integration**: Initialize repo via GitHub CLI and track work with Issues

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11+**, **Poetry** for dependency management
- **Playwright** (fallback: `httpx` + `selectolax`) for web scraping
- **pandas** for data processing
- **FastAPI** + **Jinja2** + **Tailwind (dark)** + **Plotly** for web interface
- **SQLite** via `sqlmodel` for data persistence
- **pytest**, **pytest-asyncio**, **pytest-cov**, **vcrpy**, **ruff**, **black**, **mypy** for testing
- **pre-commit** and **GitHub Actions** for CI

## Scoring Algorithm Design
- Normalize all metrics to [0..1] range, higher is better
- **Price**: Lower is better → invert after min-max with winsorized 5th/95th percentiles
- **Year**: Newer is better
- **Kilometers**: Fewer is better → invert after min-max with winsorization
- **Condition**: Map text to [0..1]; unknown → 0.5
- **Weights**: Price (0.4), Year (0.25), Km (0.25), Condition (0.1)
- Final score = `round(100 * weighted_blend)`

## Progress Log

### 1. Project Initialization ✅
- Created Poetry project structure with `poetry new bilbasen-fiat-panda-finder --name app`
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with:
  - Runtime dependencies: playwright, pandas, fastapi, uvicorn, jinja2, plotly, sqlmodel, httpx, python-dotenv, pydantic-settings, selectolax, python-multipart
  - Dev dependencies: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, vcrpy, ruff, black, mypy, types-requests, pre-commit
- Installed dependencies with `pip install -e .`
- Installed Playwright Chromium browser with `playwright install chromium`

### 2. Project Structure Creation ✅
Created directory structure:
```
bilbasen-fiat-panda-finder/
├── src/app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── scraper/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── fixtures/
│   └── ui/
│       ├── templates/
│       └── static/
├── tests/
├── .github/workflows/
├── .env.example
└── .gitignore
```

### 3. Configuration Files ✅
- Created `.env.example` with all necessary environment variables
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` for Python, Poetry, databases, IDE files, etc.

### 4. Git Repository ✅
- Initialized git repository with `git init`
- Note: GitHub CLI not available, so GitHub integration skipped for now

## Todo List Status
- [x] Initialize project structure with Poetry and dependencies
- [x] Set up GitHub repository and authentication  
- [ ] Create initial GitHub issues for tracking
- [ ] Implement config and logging modules
- [ ] Create database models and schemas
- [ ] Implement condition parsing logic
- [ ] Build Playwright scraper with rate limiting
- [ ] Implement scoring algorithm with winsorization
- [ ] Create FastAPI server and endpoints
- [ ] Build dark-themed UI with Tailwind and Plotly
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create Makefile and documentation

## Next Steps
1. Complete configuration and logging modules
2. Implement database models and schemas
3. Create condition parsing logic
4. Build the Playwright scraper with proper rate limiting
5. Implement the scoring algorithm
6. Create the FastAPI server and web interface
7. Add comprehensive testing
8. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Key Implementation Notes
- Respect robots.txt and ToS with rate limiting and polite delays
- Use descriptive User-Agent and retry logic with jitter
- Cache HTML fixtures for testing when blocked
- Keep secrets in .env (not committed)
- Include type hints, docstrings, and INFO logging
- Follow GitHub Issues workflow for tracking work

## Files Created
1. `pyproject.toml` - Updated with dependencies and project metadata
2. `.env.example` - Environment variable template
3. `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore patterns
4. Directory structure for organized codebase

The project foundation is now established and ready for core implementation.
