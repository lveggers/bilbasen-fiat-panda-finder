# Bilbasen Fiat Panda Finder - Development Log

## Project Overview
This conversation documents the development of a comprehensive Python project that scrapes Bilbasen.dk for Fiat Panda listings, scores them based on multiple criteria, and serves a dark-themed web dashboard.

## Initial Requirements
Based on the prompt from `claude_code_bilbasen_prompt.md`, the project requirements include:

1. **Web Scraping**: Scrape https://www.bilbasen.dk/ for "Fiat Panda" listings
2. **Scoring System**: Score listings on price, year, condition, kilometers (0-100 scale)
3. **Web Dashboard**: Dark, slick browser dashboard with:
   - Top 10 deals
   - Score distribution chart
   - Filters for price, year, km
4. **Testing & CI**: Thorough tests and CI pipeline
5. **GitHub Integration**: Initialize repo via GitHub CLI and track work with Issues

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11+**, **Poetry** for dependency management
- **Playwright** (fallback: `httpx` + `selectolax`) for web scraping
- **pandas** for data processing
- **FastAPI** + **Jinja2** + **Tailwind (dark)** + **Plotly** for web interface
- **SQLite** via `sqlmodel` for data persistence
- **pytest**, **pytest-asyncio**, **pytest-cov**, **vcrpy**, **ruff**, **black**, **mypy** for testing
- **pre-commit** and **GitHub Actions** for CI

## Scoring Algorithm Design
- Normalize all metrics to [0..1] range, higher is better
- **Price**: Lower is better â†’ invert after min-max with winsorized 5th/95th percentiles
- **Year**: Newer is better
- **Kilometers**: Fewer is better â†’ invert after min-max with winsorization
- **Condition**: Map text to [0..1]; unknown â†’ 0.5
- **Weights**: Price (0.4), Year (0.25), Km (0.25), Condition (0.1)
- Final score = `round(100 * weighted_blend)`
